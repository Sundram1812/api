        question: "What is the Java Collections Framework?",
        answer:
          "The Java Collections Framework is a unified architecture that represents and manipulates collections of objects, such as lists, sets, and maps. It provides several classes and interfaces to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.",
        explanation:
          "The Collections Framework is designed to simplify data handling, reduce redundancy, and improve code reusability by providing a standard interface for various collection classes like ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap.",

        answer:
          "The Collections utility class in Java provides static methods for performing operations on collections, such as sorting, searching, reversing, shuffling, and synchronizing.",
        explanation:
          "Some common methods include `sort()`, `reverse()`, `shuffle()`, `binarySearch()`, `max()`, `min()`, `synchronizedList()`, and `fill()`. These methods are designed to simplify common tasks like sorting or searching within collections.",

        answer:

        explanation:
          "Internally, TreeSet uses a Red-Black tree structure, which is a self-balancing binary search tree. It keeps the elements in ascending order by default, and when a custom comparator is provided, it uses that comparator to determine the order.",

However, inserting or removing elements at the beginning or middle of the list requires shifting elements, resulting in O(n) time complexity.

        explanation:
          "ArrayList starts with a default capacity (usually 10). As elements are added, if the capacity is reached, it doubles the size of the array to accommodate more elements.
